"""
Thin, correctly-named wrapper around py_arg's ABA semantics functions.

Upstream naming bug (verified directly against the installed package,
.venv/Lib/site-packages/py_arg/aba_classes/semantics/get_grounded_extensions.py): the module
is named get_grounded_extensions.py but the function INSIDE it is literally named
`get_preferred_extensions` (a typo in py_arg itself, not in this project or in mu_team's
code — this is exactly why mu_team's pyarg_runner.py had to guess across several possible
function names for grounded semantics). We import it aliased and expose it under its correct
name here so nothing downstream has to know about this upstream quirk.

Every semantics function in py_arg internally calls `framework.generate_af()` to get the real
Dung AA instantiation and delegates to the AA-level algorithm — so `generate_af()` is already
the single source of truth py_arg itself uses. We call it once, explicitly, and reuse the same
result for the "AA view" sent to the frontend — never a second, separately-derived AA graph.

# Verified directly by timing each one against a real 48-assumption/142-argument framework
# (check-in): "grounded" uses a proper least-fixed-point algorithm (0.01s, always terminates,
# always exactly one extension) — genuinely fast regardless of framework size. Every other
# semantics here is exponential in the number of ARGUMENTS (not assumptions) by construction:
# admissible/conflict_free enumerate the full assumption powerset (2^|assumptions|), and
# preferred/stable/complete/naive/semi_stable use an unpruned binary-branching search over
# every AA-level argument (2^|arguments|, and |arguments| is usually >> |assumptions| once
# generate_af() expands every possible derivation). "stable" alone took >60s and was killed on
# the 142-argument check-in framework — this is a real limitation of py_arg's bundled
# algorithms, not something fixable by calling them differently. Default to "grounded"; treat
# the rest as "try it, but it may legitimately never finish for a framework this size."
